Welcome to my Protein Folding project! For a quick review on the protein folding process, please see the survey-paper PDF. For a short summary of my machine learning project, take a look at the ml-project PDF.

This project treats the protein folding process as a language that should be interpretable from the primary sequence stored in our DNA. Accordingly, the Haskell code is organized into a parser and interpreter.
